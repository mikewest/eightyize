This is text. It should be wrapped as per usual for text that runs over eighty columns in length. Nothing special here.

    This, however, is preformatted text. It shouldn't be touched by the parser at all. No wrapping, no linebreak insertion.

    Even when there are multiple lines of preformatted goodness, they shouldn't be touched.

    Srsly.

This is text again. Hooray for text.
