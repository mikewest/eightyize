This is a long line that ought to be wrapped once columnize is run with it as input, and I hope it works.

Especially when dealing with multiple lines, this sort of thing is a tiny bit more difficult than it would be otherwise. I wonder what happens when one line should wrap to THREE lines. Wouldn't that be something AMAZING? I bet it would be.
